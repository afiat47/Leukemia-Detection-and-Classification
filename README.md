# Leukemia Detection and Classification
(On Going)

This repository aims to detect and classify different types of leukemia (ALL, AML, CLL, CML) using machine learning models. The classification leverages features extracted from cell images like size, shape, and chromatin density. YOLOv8 is used for initial cancer detection, followed by segmentation and feature extraction. Various machine learning models, such as Support Vector Machines (SVM), are used for classification.

## Dataset:
  -Soon will be published with codes

## Methodology

### 1. **Detection using YOLO v8**
   - **Goal**: Detect cancerous cells in microscopy images using YOLO v8.
   - **Process**: 
     - **Image Input**: Microscopy image showing blood cells.
     - **Detection**: YOLO v8 identifies regions where cells are located by drawing bounding boxes.
     - **Image**:

### 2. **Cropping by Bounding Box**
   - **Goal**: Crop the detected cells from the image for further analysis.
   - **Process**: The bounding boxes detected by YOLO are used to crop the cells.

### 3. **Watershed Cell Segmentation**
   - **Goal**: Segment individual cells.
   - **Process**: Watershed segmentation is applied to the cropped images to separate adjacent or overlapping cells.

### 4. **Multi-Otsu Nucleus Segmentation**
   - **Goal**: Segment the nucleus of each cell.
   - **Process**: Multi-Otsu segmentation method is used to distinguish the nucleus from the rest of the cell based on intensity thresholds.

### 5. **Feature Extraction**
   - **Goal**: Extract relevant features that are useful for classification.
   - **Features**: 
     - Cell Size
     - Cell Shape
     - Nucleus Shape
     - Chromatin Density
     - Nucleus-to-Cytoplasm Ratio
     - Granularity
     - Cytoplasm Texture
   - **Feature Extraction Process**:
     - Each of these features is calculated from the segmented images.

### 6. **Classification**
   - **Goal**: Classify the cells into one of the four leukemia categories:
     - **AML**: Acute Myeloid Leukemia
     - **CML**: Chronic Myeloid Leukemia
     - **CLL**: Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia
     - **ALL**: Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia
   - **Machine Learning Model**: Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest was used for classification.

#### **Confusion Matrix (SVM Model)**

Hereâ€™s the confusion matrix for the SVM model. The matrix shows how many instances from each true class were predicted as each possible class:

*The confusion matrix helps to evaluate how well the model distinguishes between the different leukemia classes.*
